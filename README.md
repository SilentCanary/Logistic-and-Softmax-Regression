# Logistic Regression
In this program, I've implemented a logistic regression model from scratch in C++ using only Eigen for matrix calculations. It is trained on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. The program simulates the hypothesis function (sigmoid), computes the cost, and uses batch gradient ascent to train the model. It evaluates the performance using confusion matrix and F1 score. 

# Softmax Regression
Implemented a softmax regression model from scratch in C++ using Eigen for multi-class classification. Trained and tested on Iris, Wine, and Digits datasets. The program uses softmax activation, cross-entropy loss, and batch gradient descent. Performance is measured by accuracy, confusion matrix, and F1 score, achieving near-perfect results on Iris and Wine, and strong accuracy (~96.7%) on Digits.
